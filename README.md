This repository contains two files, book_scraper.py and form_creator.py.  

I have tried to keep my code well documented, so if you are familiar with Python you should be able to understand it.  Regardless, I will be updating this README file in the coming weeks to help keep track of what functionality has been written.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me.
